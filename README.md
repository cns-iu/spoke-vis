## Background and More Information

The Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine ([SPOKE](https://spoke.ucsf.edu/)) graph federates about 19 open datasets into a public data commons of health relevant knowledge. This site lets users explore the massive SPOKE knowledge graph.

The site was designed for two user groups: (1) novice users interested to understand the coverage and quality of SPOKE data and (2) expert users interested to analyze and optimize the interlinked knowledge graphs in SPOKE. The overview visualization shows the different entity type and their diverse interlinkages.

SPOKE is a fully interactive tool for exploring the interconnections between data.
